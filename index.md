Made by: Jeremy Liam N. Carilimdiliman

These are the facts that made me go "that's so random" when told to me

this fact may sound shocking to some people but according to a joint survey done by Nepal and China, Mount Everest now became 29,031.69 feet or 8848.86 meters previously measured at 29,028 feet (8,848 metres) gaining an increase of a whopping 3 feet. This gives hope to me as someone who doesn't believe they will grow more than their current height although I am no mountain.



## 2. The Circulatory System is Long

This fact might be already known by people in the medical field but for a normal student like me it was really random the first time I heard it. The Circulatory System's length is more then 60,000 miles long!, This is enough to circle the world twice according to the Cleveland Clinic and this is a really interesting fact. via: [Cleveland Clinic Article](ttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17059-how-does-blood-flow-through-your-body)

The shortest war in history, the Anglo-Zanzibar war only lasted for 38 minutes maybe more depending on which source when the white flag was raised in the Golden Palace of Zanzibar. The white flag was raised due to heavy bombardmeent of the palace and the aftermath was devastating with the palace being almost blown to bits and over 500 casualties. via: [HistoryAssociation](https://www.history.org.uk/publications/resource/7950/the-shortest-war-in-history-the-anglo-zanzibar-wa)
